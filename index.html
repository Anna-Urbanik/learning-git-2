        <h1>Jungle</h1>
        <p>by Tash Sultana</p>
        <p>I see the way you move<br>
        It's fluid<br>
        Be here by my side<br>
        Got nothing to hide</p>
        <p>I know that you're hurting<br>
        I see the tears behind those eyes<br>
        And I can't wipe them clear<br>
        Your love is like gold to me<br>
        But you hold me closer to the light<br>
        With the final bullet inside<br>
        Oh, I'm surrounded by</p>
        <p>But you throw me into the deep end<br>
        Expect me to know how to swim<br>
        And I put my faith in someone else<br>
        'Cause I will be just fine</p>
        <p>Welcome to the jungle<br>
        Are you gonna dance with me<br>
        Welcome to the jungle<br>
        You got to close your eyes and see<br>
        Welcome to the jungle<br>
        Are you gonna dance with me<br>
        Well, hold on, well, hold on</p>
        <p>Suit and tie with the black jeans on and I'm paralyzed<br>
        'Cause I think you got something like the biggest soul I've ever seen<br>
        And I think you're the one<br>
        Suit and tie, with the curly hair making your way with that step and stare<br>
        So tell me real, do you feel anything</p>
        <p>Ashes to ashes<br>
        And the embers are ablaze<br>
        Oh, I gotta rise among you, though then I think about your face every day</p>
        <p>But you pull me closer to the light<br>
        You wouldn't find a bullet inside<br>
        Only if you magnify</p>
        <p>Welcome to the jungle<br>
        Are you gonna dance with me<br>
        Welcome to the jungle<br>
        You got to close your eyes and see<br>
        Welcome to the jungle<br>
        Are you gonna dance with me<br>
        Well hold on, well hold on</p>
        <p>from the album Notion EP relesead in 2016</p>
